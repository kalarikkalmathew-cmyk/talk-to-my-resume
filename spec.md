# ai-resume — Implementation Spec

Single source of truth. All design, architecture, and UX decisions consolidated here.
Reviews: CEO (CLEAR), Eng (CLEAR), Design (CLEAR at 7.4/10).

## Implementation Status (2026-04-17)

v1 core landed. Runs end-to-end via `netlify dev` at `localhost:8888`. See CLAUDE.md § "What's implemented" for the full checklist. Deploy + landing page + user validation are the remaining open tracks.

**Implemented beyond the original spec:**
- **Mark stroke-draw intro animation** (per design-consultation). 72px Patrick Hand cursive SVG stroke-draws "ac" in center of viewport (1s), then fills in + dot flashes (200ms), hold 300ms, translate+scale to header position (500ms). Total ~1.8s. Uses sessionStorage to skip on refresh within the same tab session. Reduced-motion users skip entirely. This is the signature opening moment; all other element entrances are fast/restrained to avoid feeling sluggish.
- **Patrick Hand font** for the header mark (both at intro size 72px and header size 22px) — makes the handoff from animated SVG to static header text seamless.
- **`skipCooldown` flag on sendMessage** — card and chip taps bypass the 2s user-spam cooldown so programmatic submits always fire immediately. User-typed Enter/click still enforces cooldown.

**Files that differ from first-read of this spec:** `.template-backup/` holds template source-of-truth with `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}`; `setup.js` reads from backup and writes hydrated outputs. Edits to hydrated files alone get reverted on next `node setup.js`.

## Vision

**A resume for the agent-to-agent web.** The first reader of a resume is almost always an AI now — ATS screeners, LinkedIn Recruiter AI, autonomous sourcing agents. A PDF is a dead artifact to them. ai-resume replaces the PDF with a live AI agent that represents a career: one source of truth, two surfaces (chat for humans, structured endpoint + chat API for machines). Setup takes minutes with any AI assistant.

**Three audiences, in order of product priority:**
- **Hiring AI agent**: query `/.well-known/ai-resume.json` for Schema.org career data, or stream the chat endpoint for Q&A. Agent-to-agent, no keyword lottery.
- **Human recruiter**: click link → see proof cards → ask questions → connect. The chat IS the landing page.
- **Job seeker**: paste resume → live AI agent page in minutes, coached by any AI assistant.

## Page Architecture

### Layout (flex column, 100svh)

Welcome state — cards are standalone, NOT nested in a message bubble. Greeting is plain text below the cards.

```
┌─ Header ────────────────────────────┐
│ ac. Alex Chen             [in] [✉]  │  <- persistent connect icons
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│ ┌─ Card ─────────────────────────┐ │  <- cards are TOP-LEVEL

│ career.                             │     (no container, dim color)
│                                     │
│ [what does Alex do?] [why hire?]    │  <- suggestion chips
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Ask me about Alex...       ] [↑]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Eye path**: name → card project → card metric → next card → greeting → chips → input

### Header
- Initials mark (`.mark`): accent color, 700 weight
- Name (h1): 18px, 600 weight
- Connect icons: right-aligned, LinkedIn + email, monochrome, accent on hover
- Connect icons hidden if no links configured in `resume.links`
- Each connect icon: 44px tap target

### Proof Cards
Cards are **static HTML** generated by `setup.js` (not JS-rendered). Google-crawlable.

**Card HTML structure (post-design-consultation, 2026-04-17):**

The whole card IS the button. No sub-buttons. No arrow. Company name removed from label — project + metric only. Chevron affordance in top-right. Cards are standalone elements, NEVER nested inside a message bubble.

```html
<div class="cards"> <!-- 2-col grid desktop, stack mobile -->
  <button type="button" class="card" role="article"
          aria-label="Career highlight: Design System v3, 400+ teams adopted">
    <span class="card-label">Design System v3</span>
    <span class="card-metric">400+ teams adopted</span>
  </button>
</div>
```

Tapping a card sends `tell me about [title]` into the chat input and auto-submits.

**Card CSS:**
```css
.cards {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;  /* desktop: 2-col */
  gap: 8px;
}
.card {
  position: relative;
  appearance: none; font: inherit; text-align: left; width: 100%; color: inherit; cursor: pointer;
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  border-radius: 6px;
  padding: 14px 40px 14px 16px;  /* right pad for chevron */
  background: var(--surface-2);
  transition: border-color 150ms ease-out, box-shadow 150ms ease-out, transform 100ms ease-out;
  display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 4px;
}
.card:hover { border-color: var(--accent); box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px var(--accent-15); }
.card:active { transform: scale(0.98); }
.card:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px; }

/* Chevron affordance — always visible (mobile has no hover) */
.card::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute; top: 50%; right: 16px;
  width: 7px; height: 7px;
  border-right: 1.5px solid var(--text);
  border-top: 1.5px solid var(--text);
  opacity: 0.55;
  transform: translateY(-50%) rotate(45deg);
  transition: opacity 150ms ease-out, border-color 150ms ease-out, right 150ms ease-out;
}
.card:hover::after { opacity: 1; border-color: var(--accent); right: 12px; }
.card:active::after { opacity: 1; border-color: var(--accent); }

.card-label { font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500; color: var(--text); letter-spacing: -0.01em; }
.card-metric { font-size: 15px; font-weight: 600; color: var(--accent); letter-spacing: -0.01em; }

@media (max-width: 768px) { .cards { grid-template-columns: 1fr; } }
@media (hover: none) { .card:hover { border-color: var(--border); box-shadow: none; } }
```

**Card data schema (in setup-config.json):**

The resume stores TWO highlight lists. `welcome_highlights` are rendered as static HTML by setup.js for first paint + SEO. `full_highlights` are embedded into the system prompt so the AI can surface them as inline cards during conversation (see *Cards in Conversation* section).

```json
{
  "resume": {
    "welcome_highlights": [
      {
        "title": "Design System v3",
        "metric": "400+ teams adopted",
        "timeframe": "2022-Present"
      },
      {
        "title": "Checkout Redesign",
        "metric": "+12% conversion lift",
        "timeframe": "2019-2022"
      }
    ],
    "full_highlights": [
      { "title": "Component accessibility", "metric": "WCAG AA across 40 flows", "tag": "accessibility" },
      { "title": "Onboarding redesign", "metric": "45% → 72% completion", "tag": "onboarding" },
      { "title": "Design ops tooling", "metric": "used by 80 designers", "tag": "tools" }
    ],
    "skills": ["Design Systems", "Figma", "Accessibility"],
    "links": { "linkedin": "...", "email": "..." },
    "contact_preference": "email"
  }
}
```

- `welcome_highlights`: 2-4 items. Rendered on first paint. Company is NOT stored here (removed from card label per 2026-04-17 design decision).
- `full_highlights`: 4-16 items. Never rendered on first paint. Embedded into the system prompt as a markdown list so the AI can surface them when asked for list-type questions.
- Wizard pushes hard for both. `welcome_highlights` empty → fallback to text-only welcome (absolute last resort). `full_highlights` empty → AI can't render cards in conversation; falls back to text bubbles for list-questions.

### Suggestion Chips
- Appear below greeting text
- Max 3 chips
- Removed from DOM on first message send
- `border-radius: 16px` (pill shape)
- 44px minimum tap target
- Mobile: horizontal scroll (not wrap)

## Cards in Conversation

**The product differentiator.** Cards are the unit of proof. They appear on the welcome state AND reappear dynamically during conversation whenever the AI answers a list-type question.

Without this, the cards thesis collapses halfway through the experience — the AI falls back to text bubbles for the rest of the session, and we lose the scannability advantage. With this, the product stays coherent end-to-end.

### Invariant: cards never nest inside bubbles

Text lives in bubbles. Cards are standalone visual elements. This rule is mirrored from the welcome state and enforces the product's design grammar. The card is always top-level in the `.messages` flex column, never wrapped in `.msg.assistant`.

### UX rule: when cards appear vs when they don't

| Question type | Response shape | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| List / multi-item ask | Text intro bubble + inline cards (standalone) + text follow-up bubble | "what projects?", "show me her X work", "what else has she shipped?", "her biggest impacts?" |
| Narrative / single-item ask | Text bubble only, no cards | "tell me about Design System v3", "how did X go?", "why did she leave Stripe?" |
| Yes-no or single fact | Short text bubble | "is she open to relocating?", "how long at Figma?" |

Predictability is the product. Recruiters learn the pattern in 2 exchanges. Ask a list-type question → always cards. Ask a narrative question → always text. Random inconsistency would break trust.

### Composition of a cards-in-response turn

Three rows in the `.messages` flex column, separated by the standard 12px gap:

```
[AI intro bubble — short text: "Three more worth mentioning:"]
[Cards — 2-4 .card buttons inside a .cards grid, standalone]
[AI follow-up bubble — short text: "Which one?"]
```

Cards are direct children of `.messages`, same as welcome state. Tap behavior is identical: tap → inject `tell me about [title]` into input and send.

### Card markup syntax (in AI output)

The AI emits cards inline in its streaming response using this exact syntax:

```
[CARD: Project Title | Metric]
```

Example raw AI output for "show me more of her work":

```
Three more worth mentioning:
[CARD: Component accessibility | WCAG AA across 40 flows]
[CARD: Onboarding redesign | 45% → 72% completion]
[CARD: Design ops tooling | used by 80 designers]
Which one?
```

### Client-side parser (in index.html)

During streaming, the client detects `[CARD:...|...]` markers and swaps them for rendered card components. ~60 lines.

```js
const CARD_RE = /\[CARD:\s*([^|\]]+?)\s*\|\s*([^\]]+?)\s*\]/g;

function splitAIResponse(rawText) {
  // Returns ordered array: [{type:'text', content}, {type:'card', title, metric}, ...]
  const parts = [];
  let lastIndex = 0;
  let match;
  while ((match = CARD_RE.exec(rawText)) !== null) {
    if (match.index > lastIndex) {
      const text = rawText.slice(lastIndex, match.index).trim();
      if (text) parts.push({ type: 'text', content: text });
    }
    parts.push({ type: 'card', title: match[1].trim(), metric: match[2].trim() });
    lastIndex = match.index + match[0].length;
  }
  if (lastIndex < rawText.length) {
    const text = rawText.slice(lastIndex).trim();
    if (text) parts.push({ type: 'text', content: text });
  }
  return parts;
}
```

On stream completion, the accumulated text is re-parsed and rendered as alternating `.msg.assistant` bubbles (text segments) and standalone `.cards` grids (card segments), in order, as siblings in `.messages`.

**During streaming** (before `[DONE]`), show text streaming into a single `.msg.assistant` bubble as usual. When the stream completes, if any `[CARD:...]` markers are found, re-render that turn into the alternating-parts layout. This means users see text stream naturally, then cards "resolve" at the end of the turn rather than mid-stream. Simpler, more robust against malformed markup mid-stream.

**Malformed markers** (missing pipe, unclosed bracket) degrade gracefully to plain text — the regex simply doesn't match and the raw text is preserved.

### System prompt guidance

Add this block to `system-prompt.md` (the setup.js template includes it by default, positioned after the persona section):

```
## When to use cards

When the user asks for a LIST of 2 or more projects with quantifiable impact, respond with inline cards using this EXACT syntax:

[CARD: Project Title | Metric]

### Use cards for:
- List questions: "what projects?", "show me her X work", "what else has she shipped?"
- Category filters: "her ML work", "her design work", "her side projects"
- Comparisons: "her biggest impacts", "her most senior work"

### Do NOT use cards for:
- Single-item deep dives: "tell me about X", "how did X go?"
- Narrative questions: "why did she leave?", "what's her style?"
- Yes/no or single facts: "is she available?", "how long at Y?"

### Rules:
- Max 3 cards per response
- Always precede cards with a short intro sentence ("Three worth mentioning:")
- Always follow cards with a short follow-up question ("Which one?")
- Do NOT repeat a project that's already in the welcome cards — pick others from the full highlights list
- The full highlights list available to you: {{FULL_HIGHLIGHTS_MARKDOWN}}
```

The `{{FULL_HIGHLIGHTS_MARKDOWN}}` placeholder is filled by setup.js from `full_highlights[]` in setup-config.json, as a markdown bulleted list with title + metric + tag.

### Interaction states for inline cards

| State | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Rendering | Cards appear AFTER the stream completes for the turn (not mid-stream). Staggered fade-in, 100ms per card. |
| Tap | Same as welcome: inject `tell me about [title]` into input, auto-submit. |
| Welcome cards above | Remain at 50% opacity. Do NOT un-fade. The conversation cards are fresh; the welcome ones served their purpose. |
| Scroll | Inline cards scroll naturally with message history. Auto-scroll keeps the most recent AI response visible. |
| Failure mode | Malformed `[CARD:...]` markers render as plain text, not broken HTML. |

---

## Interaction States

| Feature | Loading | Empty | Error | Success | Partial |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Welcome cards | N/A (static HTML) | Text-only welcome (last resort) | N/A | Cards standalone (no bubble wrap), greeting text below | Fade 50% after first message sent |
| Card tap | N/A | N/A | N/A | Tap → inject `tell me about [title]` → auto-submit. Active: scale(0.98) 100ms, chevron flashes accent. | N/A |
| Inline cards (in-conversation) | Render after stream completes | No cards → text-only response | Malformed markup → plain text | Staggered fade-in, 100ms per card | Cards render at turn boundary only, not mid-stream |
| Chat stream | Cursor blink immediately, "still thinking..." at 5s | N/A | "try again?" + retry btn | Cursor → text → remove cursor | Show accumulated text + retry |
| Suggestion chips | N/A | Skip if 0 questions | N/A | 3 chips below greeting | Removed on first send |
| Agent endpoint | N/A | Minimal JSON (name only) | N/A | Full Schema.org Person | N/A |

### Card Lifecycle
1. **Arrival** (welcome): hero content. Recruiter scans 3-4 impacts (6-second signal)
2. **Browsing**: interactive — hover glow on desktop, chevron affordance always visible. Whole card is the button.
3. **First interaction**: cards fade to 50% opacity (300ms transition). Conversation takes over.
4. **During conversation**: welcome cards scroll up naturally on mobile, stay at 50% opacity. No sticky.
5. **Dynamic re-emergence**: when the recruiter asks a list-type question ("what projects?", "show me her X work"), the AI emits inline cards within its response. These are FRESH cards (2-4 of them, pulled from `full_highlights`), not re-renders of the welcome cards. Same `.card` component, same tap behavior. See *Cards in Conversation*.
6. **Conversion**: persistent connect icons in header — never lost throughout the session.

### Chat Streaming
- SSE via `/.netlify/functions/groqHandler`
- 30ms throttled DOM updates (~33fps)
- Cursor blink during stream
- "Still thinking..." after 5s with no data
- 15s timeout (cold start + model cascade)
- Send cooldown: 2000ms between sends
- Max 6 messages in history (in-memory, no localStorage)
- Haptic feedback on send: `navigator.vibrate?.([10])` (feature-detected)

### Error Messages (network-aware)
| Condition | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| 15s timeout | "taking longer than expected. try again?" |
| AbortError | "lost connection. try again?" |
| HTTP 429 | "busy right now. try again in a minute." |
| HTTP 500+ | "something went wrong on our end." |
| `navigator.onLine === false` | "you're offline. check your connection." |
| Default | "something went wrong. try again?" |

All errors show retry button. Retry has exponential backoff: 2s first, 5s second, max 3 attempts. Button disabled during delay with countdown.

### Message Actions
Each assistant message has action icons (appear on tap/hover, auto-hide after 3s):
- **Copy**: `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`. Brief "Copied" toast (1.5s, bottom-center).
- **Share**: `navigator.share({ text })` with feature detection. Falls back to copy.

## Mobile Spec (100% First-Class)

This is a Product Hunt launch. Mobile must be top-tier, not just "responsive."

### Performance Targets
| Metric | Target | How |
|--------|--------|-----|
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.5s on 3G | Inline critical CSS, skeleton HTML, `font-display: swap` |
| Largest Contentful Paint | < 2.5s on 3G | Proof cards are static HTML (no JS wait) |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | < 0.1 | Reserve message heights, `contain: content` on messages |
| Time to Interactive | < 3s on 3G | Single inline script, no external JS deps |

### Skeleton Loading State
On slow networks, page must never show a blank dark screen. Inline skeleton HTML (no JS dependency):
- Header: visible immediately (static HTML)
- Card placeholders: 2-3 rectangles with CSS pulse animation
- Input area: visible immediately (static HTML)

```css
@keyframes skeleton-pulse {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 0.06; }
  50% { opacity: 0.12; }
}
.skeleton-card {
  height: 80px;
  border-radius: 6px;
  background: var(--surface);
  animation: skeleton-pulse 1.5s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

JS replaces skeleton with real proof cards on hydration. Skeleton is a `<div id="skeleton">` removed after init.

### Viewport & Layout
| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Reference viewport | 375px width (tested down to 320px) |
| Body height | `height: var(--vh, 100svh)` with JS fallback |
| Layout | flex column: header (shrink 0) → message-list (flex 1) → input (shrink 0) |
| Safe areas | `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` on input area |

**dvh/svh JavaScript fallback (iOS Safari 26+ compatibility):**
```js
function setVH() {
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--vh', window.innerHeight + 'px');
}
setVH();
window.addEventListener('resize', setVH);
```

### Touch Targets (Apple HIG: 44px minimum)
| Element | Target size |
|---------|-------------|
| Card (whole card is the button) | min 60px height per card, full width on mobile, generous vertical padding |
| Suggestion chips | 44px height, 8px gap |
| Send button | 44px × 44px |
| Header connect icons | 44px × 44px each |
| Retry button | 44px height |

### Touch Interactions
| Interaction | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| Card tap | active state: `scale(0.98)` for 100ms |
| Chip tap | same active state pattern |
| Send tap | haptic: `navigator.vibrate?.([10])` |
| Hover on touch devices | disabled via `@media (hover: none)` — use `:focus-visible` only |
| Scroll | native, `overscroll-behavior: contain`, passive listeners |
| Pull-to-refresh | blocked by `overscroll-behavior: contain` |
| Tap delay | eliminated: `touch-action: manipulation` on all interactive elements |
| Message tap | show copy/share action icons (auto-hide after 3s) |

**Critical CSS for tap delay removal:**
```css
button, a, .card, .chip, .retry-btn, .connect-icon, .msg-action { touch-action: manipulation; }
```

### iOS Keyboard
| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Height | `var(--vh, 100svh)` + `visualViewport` resize listener + JS fallback |
| Input zoom prevention | `font-size: 16px` on textarea |
| Input position | flex-based (NOT `position: fixed`) |
| Safe area | `padding-bottom: max(12px, env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` |

### Orientation Change
Save scroll ratio on `orientationchange`, restore after layout reflow:
```js
let scrollRatio = 0;
window.addEventListener('orientationchange', () => {
  scrollRatio = messagesEl.scrollTop / messagesEl.scrollHeight;
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      messagesEl.scrollTop = scrollRatio * messagesEl.scrollHeight;
    });
  });
});
```

```

Cards stack vertically, full width. No 2-col grid on mobile. Each card has generous padding (12px 16px) and clear visual separation (8px gap).

### CLS Prevention
- Pre-allocate streaming message container at estimated min-height
- `contain: content` on `.message` elements
- Reserve card grid height before content renders (skeleton matches real layout)
- No layout shifts from font loading (`font-display: swap` on Inter)

### Font Scaling
Test at Android "Large" and "Largest" text sizes. Use `rem` for most sizing, `px` only for borders and icons. Ensure:
- Card labels don't overflow
- Chips don't break layout  
- Input area scales proportionally
- Message max-width adapts

### Browser Compatibility
| Browser | Key concern |
|---------|-------------|
| Safari iOS | `var(--vh)` fallback, visualViewport, safe-area-inset, no position:fixed input |
| Safari iOS 26+ | Viewport height changes — dvh/svh JS fallback required |
| Chrome Android | Standard, auto-grow textarea, haptic via Vibration API |
| Samsung Internet | Empty Origin header in CORS, touch target sizing |
| Firefox Android | Standard |

---

## Accessibility

| Feature | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Skip link | Hidden, visible on `:focus`, jumps to input area |
| Card semantics | `role="article"`, `aria-label="Career highlight: [title] at [company]"` |
| Card CTAs | `role="button"`, descriptive `aria-label` |
| Connect icons | `aria-label="Connect on LinkedIn"` / `"Send email"` |
| Tab order | cards → greeting → chips → input → send |
| Focus ring | 2px accent outline, offset 2px, `:focus-visible` only |
| Reduced motion | `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` disables animations |
| Message list | `aria-live="polite"` |
| Card fade announcement | Screen reader announces "Proof cards dismissed, conversation active" |

---

## Data Flow

```
resume.md ──[Any AI assistant]──→ system-prompt.md (persona + card rules + {{FULL_HIGHLIGHTS_MARKDOWN}} placeholder)
                                → setup-config.json (with welcome_highlights[], full_highlights[], skills, links)
                                → setup.js → index.html (welcome cards + greeting + chips + JSON-LD + skeleton + card parser for inline cards)
                                           → system-prompt.md (injects full_highlights as markdown)
                                           → groqHandler.mjs (CORS origins)
                                           → ai-resume.json (agent endpoint, includes welcome_highlights + full_highlights merged)
                                           → manifest.json (PWA)
                                           → Smart og:description (from welcome_highlights[0])
```

### What the AI Assistant Does vs What setup.js Does

| Task | Who | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Write resume.md from user input | AI assistant | AI understands career narratives |
| Generate system-prompt.md | AI assistant | AI crafts better prompts |
| Extract welcome highlights (2-4) | AI assistant | Needs career understanding |
| Extract full highlights library (4-16) | AI assistant | Same understanding, deeper pull for in-conversation cards |
| Write setup-config.json | AI assistant | Collects name, palette, domain, both highlight lists |
| Replace {{PLACEHOLDERS}} in all files | setup.js | Reproducible, re-runnable, atomic |
| Generate welcome card HTML | setup.js | Static HTML for SEO |
| Embed full_highlights into system-prompt.md | setup.js | Gives AI the library to pull from in conversation |
| Parse `[CARD:...]` markers during streaming | index.html client | Renders inline conversation cards |
| Render .card component | shared | Same CSS + behavior for welcome + inline conversation cards |
| Generate connect icons | setup.js | Conditional on links config |
| Generate JSON-LD | setup.js | From setup-config.json data |
| Generate ai-resume.json | setup.js | Static file for agent endpoint |
| Generate .env | AI assistant | Sensitive key handling |

---

## Agent Endpoint (`/.well-known/ai-resume.json`)

Static file generated by setup.js. CDN-cached. Zero infrastructure.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Alex Chen",
  "jobTitle": "Senior Product Designer",
  "description": "Design systems, checkout flows, and accessibility at scale.",
  "worksFor": { "@type": "Organization", "name": "Figma" },
  "knowsAbout": ["Design Systems", "Figma", "Accessibility"],
  "sameAs": ["https://linkedin.com/in/alexchen"],
  "ai-resume": {
    "version": "2.0",
    "availability": "open",
    "contactPreference": "email",
    "chatEndpoint": "/.netlify/functions/groqHandler",
    "highlights": [
      { "title": "Design System v3", "metric": "400+ teams adopted", "timeframe": "2022-Present" },
      { "title": "Checkout Redesign", "metric": "+12% conversion lift", "timeframe": "2019-2022" },
      { "title": "Component accessibility", "metric": "WCAG AA across 40 flows", "tag": "accessibility" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Served via Netlify redirect:
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/.well-known/ai-resume.json"
  to = "/ai-resume.json"
  status = 200
```

---

## PWA (Progressive Web App)

Add-to-homescreen support. Makes the product feel native, not "clearly a website."

**index.html `<head>` additions:**
```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="{{CSS_BG}}">
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icon-192.png">
```

**manifest.json (generated by setup.js):**
```json
{
  "name": "Chat with {{NAME}}",
  "short_name": "{{NAME}}",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "{{CSS_BG}}",
  "theme_color": "{{CSS_BG}}",
  "icons": [{ "src": "/icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" }]
}
```

Icon: generated from initials mark during setup (canvas → PNG export), or ships with a default icon.

The `theme-color` meta tag makes Android Chrome and iOS Safari blend the address bar with the page background. Critical for dark themes — without it, there's a jarring color mismatch.

---

## Smart OG Description

Conversation-style format generated from strongest highlight:
> "Why should I hire Alex?" "She shipped a checkout redesign that lifted conversion 12%."

Generated by setup.js from `resume.welcome_highlights[0]`.

---

## Resume Coach (Wizard Step)

Inline in the setup conversation. Not a separate file.

**5-dimension scorecard:**
1. Specificity (vague "responsible for" → specific outcomes)
2. Metrics (bullets with numbers)
3. Impact language (strong verbs)
4. Consistency (tense, format)
5. Completeness (skills, education, dates)

**Zero metrics policy:** Wizard pushes HARD. Asks "How many users? What % improvement? How much revenue?" Only generates qualitative cards ("Led team of 5") as last resort after coaching.

---

## Multi-Agent Setup

| Tier | Tool | Time | Method |
|------|------|------|--------|
| 1 (agentic) | Claude Code, Codex CLI | ~10 min | CLAUDE.md — clone, write files, deploy |
| 2 (generative) | ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude Desktop | ~20-30 min | SETUP-GUIDE.md — generate files, user copies |
| 3 (manual) | README.md | ~30-45 min | Edit files directly |

## Security

- [ ] `.gitignore` excludes `.env`
- [ ] CORS allows configured domain + localhost + empty origin (Samsung Internet)
- [ ] Injection filter: 4 regex patterns preserved
- [ ] `GROQ_API_KEY` never in client-side code
- [ ] `netlify.toml` uses `included_files` for system-prompt.md
- [ ] setup.js validates no `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` remains
- [ ] Custom palette contrast validated (WCAG AA)
- [ ] HTML-entity escaping on all user values inserted into HTML
- [ ] JS string escaping for backtick and `</script>` contexts
- [ ] textContent for all chat rendering (no innerHTML XSS)
- [ ] Localhost CORS regex fixed (`http://localhost.evil.com` blocked)

---

## Verification Plan

### Functional
1. Fresh clone → CLAUDE.md flow → deploy → chat works
2. All 4 palettes (setup.js + visual)
3. Eval harness: 12/12 on demo, actionable failures on sparse resume
4. Proof cards: render, correct hierarchy, hover/focus, fade after interaction
5. Connect icons: in header, correct links, hidden if no links
6. ai-resume.json: valid JSON, Schema.org, at /.well-known/
7. OG card: conversation-style preview on Twitter/LinkedIn

### Mobile (test on real devices)
8. Safari iOS: keyboard handling, safe areas, input doesn't jump
9. Chrome Android: standard behavior, haptic on send
10. Samsung Internet: CORS with empty origin, touch targets
11. Firefox Android: standard behavior
12. Skeleton: visible on throttled 3G, replaced by real content
13. Touch targets: all interactive elements ≥ 44px
14. Tap delay: no 300ms lag on card/chip/button taps
15. Copy button: appears on message tap, copies text, shows toast
16. Share button: Web Share API on supported browsers, fallback to copy
17. Orientation change: scroll position preserved on rotate
18. Offline: "you're offline" message shown
19. Retry: backoff works (2s → 5s → stop after 3)
20. PWA: Add to Home Screen shows correct icon and name
21. Font scaling: test at Android "Large" text — no overflow, no broken layout
22. CLS: < 0.1 measured via Lighthouse mobile audit

### Security
23. .env not in git, CORS blocks unknowns, injection filter works

### Accessibility
24. Keyboard: tab through cards → chips → input, focus rings, skip link
25. Screen reader: aria-live, card labels, action descriptions
26. Reduced motion: animations disabled when system preference set

## Decision Audit Trail

| # | Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | CEO | Chat IS the landing page | Eliminates landing-vs-chat debate, solves cold-start |
| 2 | CEO | Impact cards, not role cards | Works across all career stages |
| 3 | CEO | Machine-readable agent endpoint | 30 min effort, biggest differentiator |
| 4 | CEO | Multi-agent setup | Product for all job seekers, not just CC users |
| 5 | Eng | Killed resume-parser.js | AI > regex for career narratives |
| 6 | Eng | textContent not innerHTML | XSS safety > formatting (30-word responses) |
| 7 | Eng | Fix localhost CORS regex | `http://localhost.evil.com` bypass |
| 8 | Eng | Fix SSE chunk splitting | TCP fragmentation drops tokens |
| 9 | Eng | Client-side 2s send cooldown | Prevents Groq rate limit exhaustion |
| 10 | Design | Cards-first welcome hierarchy | Recruiter sees proof in 6 seconds |
| 11 | Design | Linear design system | Professional, sharp, premium feel |
| 12 | Design | Cards fade after first interaction | Conversation takes over |
| 13 | Design | Persistent header connect icons | Conversion path never lost |
| 14 | Design | Inter font (not system-ui) | Intentional, not a default |
| 15 | Design | Tight border-radius (6px) | Linear's professional feel vs bubbly |
| 16 | Design | Wizard pushes hard for highlights | Don't gracefully fall back |
| 17 | Design | 100% mobile-first | Touch, swipe, tap — not just responsive |
| 18 | DX | Pre-hydrate with demo values | TTHW drops from 30 min to 2 min |
| 19 | Mobile | Skeleton loading state | Blank dark screen = bounce on slow 3G |
| 20 | Mobile | Copy/share buttons on messages | Recruiters share AI responses with hiring managers |
| 21 | Mobile | touch-action: manipulation | 300ms tap delay kills perceived quality |
| 22 | Mobile | PWA manifest + theme-color | Add to Home Screen = "real product" signal |
| 23 | Mobile | Network-specific error messages | "try again?" is too vague for network issues |
| 24 | Mobile | Retry with exponential backoff | Mashing retry on bad network = rate limit |
| 25 | Mobile | Orientation scroll preservation | Rotating phone loses conversation place |
| 26 | Mobile | CLS prevention (contain: content) | Layout shift on message insert = visible jank |
| 27 | Mobile | Haptic feedback on send | WhatsApp/iMessage/ChatGPT all provide it |
| 28 | Mobile | font-display: swap | Inter blocks render on slow 3G without it |
| 29 | Mobile | dvh/svh JS fallback | iOS Safari 26+ changed viewport behavior |
| 30 | Mobile | Share via Web Share API | Native share sheet > clipboard only |
| 31 | Design3 | Remove company from card label | Company adds noise, creates length edge cases, doesn't survive the 6-second scan. Project + metric is the hit. Company still lives in resume.md + agent endpoint. |
| 32 | Design3 | Kill "Ask about this" / "Connect →" sub-buttons | Nested clickable areas are UX slop. Whole card is the button. Connect lives globally in header. No decorative arrows. |
| 33 | Design3 | Remove message bubble wrapping around welcome cards | Cards are the page's landing content, not an AI "response." Bubbles are for narrative text. Cards are standalone visual elements. Invariant. |
| 34 | Design3 | Cards reappear in conversation (inline) for list-type questions | The thesis is "cards reduce verbosity + add interactivity." Without conversational cards, thesis collapses after first message. THE product differentiator vs cv-santiago and others. |
| 35 | Design3 | `[CARD: title \| metric]` markup syntax for AI output | Minimal, regex-parseable, degrades gracefully to plain text on malformed markers. ~60 lines of client parser. |
| 36 | Design3 | setup-config splits `welcome_highlights` (2-4) + `full_highlights` (4-16) | Welcome cards are static HTML for SEO; full highlights are prompt-embedded so AI can surface them. Separation enables both. |
| 37 | Design3 | Persistent chevron affordance in card top-right | Mobile has no hover. Chevron (7px, opacity 0.55 at rest) is the always-visible "tap me" signal. Accent + right-shift on hover reinforces. |
| 38 | Design3 | UX rule: cards for list-questions, text for narrative | Predictability = trust. Same question type always produces same response shape. Recruiters learn the pattern in 2 exchanges. |

## Next Steps

1. **`/design-consultation`** — Create DESIGN.md formalizing the Linear-inspired design system as the project's design source of truth. The tokens live in this spec but need a proper design system doc with usage guidelines.
2. **Implement** — Build from spec.md. Tasks 1-12 in PLAN.md, in order.
